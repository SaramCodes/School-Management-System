## (▰˘◡˘▰)School Management System(▰˘◡˘▰)

I made this project just for fun and to practice my Django skills so far. I also took my time designing the website. I've attached the psd of the Home Page. Here are the details of the project (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ:

* There are teachers, students, and admin ┏(＾0＾)┛┗(＾0＾) ┓.

* Admin holds the right to do and perform each and every CRUD operation while the teachers and students can only change their profile info to a certain extent or only view their information.

* Added the functionality of a profile picture. If you don't assign one, A rice ball image is the default profile picture for everyone in such case.

* Only one teacher can be added to a class and multiple students can be added to a single class.

* Techer can grade the students. Only those subjects will show which are taught in the class the student is currently in.

* Teacher can mark attendence. of the students of their class.

* Students can view their attendences.

* Only Admin can add new semesters, subjects and classes.

Well those were the details.



## v(ಥ ̯ ಥ)v To Run The Program :

First use a virtual environment and install everything listed in requirements.txt. The admin email is : "admin@company.com" and the password is: "aaaa1111".

If however you wish to start fresh, just delete the db.sqlite3 file. Then run manage.py migrate and you'll be on your way. However, **please note that the program will not work if you delete the migraions. Don't delete the migrations (you can delete the ones ending with .pyc though). I'm sure there's a workaround but seeing my models.py files and going through the trouble of changing them is kinda too scary atm. T_T ಥ⌣ಥ இ_இ**



Feel free to use it any way you like! :D
