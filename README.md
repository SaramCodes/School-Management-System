## School Management System

I made this project just for fun and to practice my Django skills so far. I also took my time designing the website. I've attached the psd of the Home Page. Here are the details of the project:

* There are teachers, students, and admin.

* Admin holds the right to do and perform each and every CRUD operation while the teachers and students can only change their profile info to a certain extent or only view their information.

* Added the functionality of a profile picture. If you don't assign one, A rice ball image is the default profile picture for everyone in such case.

* Only one teacher can be added to a class and multiple students can be added to a single class.

* Techer can grade the students. Only those subjects will show which are taught in the class the student is currently in.

* Only Admin can add new semesters, subjects and classes.

Well those were the details.

### What i've done so far:

I've done most of the work. I've made all the relavent views and everything for the admin excecpt the roll call view. I will be updating it in a few days. I've enabaled the teacher to be able to grade only his/her's class students.

### What is left:

I still have to make the views for the student. I have yet to make the views for the Roll Calls. I will be updating the full project in about a week.


Feel free to use it any way you like! :D
